## About
A full-stack web application that allows you to find your best buddy, a play date. It's complete with a modern design made using React.js, styled with TailwindCSS, animated with Framer Motion. The user can sign up for an account then get to creating their dog's profile. It allows dog-owners to collaborate in an effort to help their furry friend live their best life. Our team was able to design and implement a RESTful API using Spring Boot with full CRUD functionality that communicates with the frontend authenticated with JSON Web Tokens.
